To discuss with authors:

1. If assignment of LR=0.01 to inconsistencies is still done by Brazlian labs,
and if we should still put emphasis on it. Is there any citations for this
procedure?

2. If procedure to calculate allele frequencies is reasonable.
Especially the solution for alleles present in the parents, but not in the
children.

* Alternative:
To exclude child's haplotypes from the parents, use all "independent" haplotypes
and divide by 4N.

3. Mutation rates in Step-wise model, including mutation range and point
mutation rate. I'm currently using range = 0.1, and point mutation rate =
0.00001.

4. Mutation rates for markers not available from STRbase, as asked by one of
the reviewers.
