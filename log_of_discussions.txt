To discuss with authors:

1. If procedure to calculate allele frequencies is reasonable.

Especially cases of alleles present in the parents, and not in the children

* Alternative:
Exclude haplotype in the child from the parents, use all "independent" haplotypes and divide by
4N

2. Mutation rates in Step-wise model, including mutation range and point mutation rate.
2.1 Mutation rates for markers not available from STRbase, as asked by one of the reviewers.

3. If simulation in the original submission adds anything relevant to the discussions.

Maybe relevant to show the rate of false inclusion in a large databse of truly unrelated AF-child pairs, and compare it with what we observe in the real data.
