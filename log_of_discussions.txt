To discuss with authors:

1. If procedure to calculate allele frequencies is reasonable.

Especially the solution for alleles present in the parents, but not in the
children.

* Alternative:
To exclude child's haplotypes from the parents, use all "independent" haplotypes
and divide by 4N.

2. Mutation rates in Step-wise model, including mutation range and point
mutation rate. I'm currently using range = 0.1, and point mutation rate =
0.00001.

3. Mutation rates for markers not available from STRbase, as asked by one of
the reviewers.

4. To discuss the relevance of simulation.
Maybe relevant to show the rate of false inclusion in a large database of truly
unrelated AF-child pairs, and compare it with what we observe in the real data.
